enablement of separate:
member and admin are done, just coach are left

What are the differentiator of ID's between these people
----------------------------
LOGIN:
in login page:
put a sidebar instead, for:

1) Admin login
2) Coach login
3) Member login

----------------------------
REGISTRATION:
whats for member registration?
only basics stuff first like:

1) username
2) password
3) gender
4) dob

...email verification? idk

other they can complete later when logged in.

i just had a thought....not everyone can be logged in.
member that had been registered BY THE ADMIN is.
otherwise member will be able to register on their own. they would need approval first by the admin.
eligibility and stuff.

or have them sign a form, to then be reviewed by the admin. so that not any can just register. this need its own dedicated page
or you could just register but your access are limited until you are fully approved by the admin. like you cant enter tournament/event and stuff.



ALSO ON ADMIN SIDE:
on registration page,
allow for choosing different authority,
makes it easier to register member or staff.
----------------------------
Mobile Support:
also if theres time, put mobile support, useful for online demonstration


----------------------------
in Planning Section, 

we will have labels, this is useful for:
labelling an event as:

1) regular event
2) tournament
3) collaboration

the timetable would be able to access from the outside

in Routine Section, 


Allow choosing Plan Type instead of having to manually input Plan ID

for image upload, allow seeing preview of it
